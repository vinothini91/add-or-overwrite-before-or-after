In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. 

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts

such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism.

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class.

An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. 

Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.
